# Blog

This was the first iteration I had for a blog. I developed everything entirely from HTML & CSS and made everything as responsive as possible. Although I have largely moved on to a much more feature heavy Jekyll blog, and everything here can be accomplished from a basic tutorial, I like leaving this site up on my GitHub as a respresentation of what I can achieve with pure HTML & CSS. 

I'm also a huge fan of some of the styles I implemented, I tend to reference to color scheme from time to time.
