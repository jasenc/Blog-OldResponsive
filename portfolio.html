        <img src="assets/linkedin.jpg"/>
        <p>Aside from currently learning Web Development, as well as any other programming that comes up along the way: I recently relocated myself to Portland, OR and haven't been happier since; I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering and have worked for a top performing S&#38;P 500 company (hint: you most likely have at least one product from this company in your bathroom); when I'm not learning, or working, I enjoy being outside as much as possible.</p>
